                <h1>History of JavaScript</h1>
                <p>JavaScript language comes from the times when early web browsers were being developed. Netscape
                    Communications company in 1994 created Netscape Navigator that became the most popular web browser
                    in the 90s.</p>

                    <h2>Netscape's Communications</h2>
                    <p>Company’s board quickly realized that browsers should allow create more dynamic websites and do
                        some activities that do server-side languages, like input validation. First Netscape
                        Communications cooperate with Sun Microsystems to use in Netscape Navigator Sun’s programming
                        language Java. Then they wanted adopting and embedding a existing programming language like
                        Scheme, Perl or Python. Eventually they decided to create scripting language that would
                        complement Java and has a similar syntax.</p>
                    <p>In 1995 Netscape Communications employed Brendan Eich to develop scripting language for web
                        browser. Eich prepared it in a very short time. First version of new language had Mocha name,
                        whereas official version used in Netscape Navigator 2 beta version was called LiveScript. In the
                        same 1995 year new developed scripting language was renamed to JavaScript and used in next beta
                        version of Netscape Navigator 2. LiveScript followed a lot of Java features. This, but above all
                        the desire to use the growing popularity of Java to call positive associations with a new
                        language where reasons that it was finally called JavaScript. Also implementation of the
                        language for server-side was introduced.</p>

                <div class="description-2">
                    <h2>JavaScript's version</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript 1.0 was a success and helped Netscape Navigator’s to hold the leader position of the
                        market. Soon JavaScript 1.1 was released in Netscape Navigator 3.</p>
                    <p>In this time Microsoft to compete with Netscape decided to include scripting technologies in
                        their browser. In 1996 they released Internet Explorer 3 with their own implementation of
                        JavaScript called JScript.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="description-3">
                    <h2>Compatibility Issue</h2>
                    <p>Since that time there were two versions of JavaScript. This brought a compatibility issues.
                        Industry needs caused that decided to standardize language. Netscape submitted JavaScript to
                        Ecma International to “standardize the syntax and semantics of a general purpose,
                        cross-platform, vendor-neutral scripting language”. In 1997 was published the language
                        specification called ECMAScript as a ECMA-262 standard. Other browser vendors could use this
                        specification to prepare their implementation.</p>
                    <p>In the following years, the development of JavaScript was continued and in cycles were released
                        new versions of specification. Responsible for the development of JavaScript are Mozilla
                        Fundation (which is successor of Netscape Navigator) and Ecma International.</p>
